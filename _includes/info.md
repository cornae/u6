Comes a time to put al of that energie and passion in something that represents who we are, we call it “U6”

It all started at Singel 101 8 years a go. 
It was a start of a beautifull collaboration with 2 of zeven sisters.

Now we had the chance to expande our selves with a new concept.
And with the support and love of all the sisters we have reached our goal.

We look forward to seeing you soon!
